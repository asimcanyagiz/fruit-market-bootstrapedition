# fruit-market-bootstrapedition
 Its a bootstrap task 1 for patika.dev. Made by cooperation with my previous task "fruit-market-project".
 In this project I learned responsive design. Like cards, when the page getting smaller only 1 cards we can see. If page getting bigger we see  more cards in a one row.
